    "description": "A man wearing nothing but his undergarments and a gas mask careens his RV down a desolate highway in the New Mexico desert. In the passenger seat, another man is passed out, also wearing a gas mask, his head on the dashboard. Two bodies slide across the RV floor until the vehicle veers into a ditch. The hyperventilating driver, Walter White, climbs out, dons the shirt still hanging off the side view mirror (his pants are long since gone), then re-enters the van to retrieve a video camera, his wallet, and a gun. He records a cryptic, handheld farewell to his wife and son as sirens can be heard in the distance. He then places the camera alongside his wallet, walks onto the road, and awaits the approach of the emergency services, gun in hand.",

Later, still in flashback, Hector \"Tio\" Salamanca seethes silently in a nursing home as he watches news coverage of the shootings. Gus drops by for a visit, switches off the TV set, props himself on a chair opposite Hector and offers to better recount the events for him personally. Almost victoriously Gus describes his nephews' - the Cousins' - deaths, and the cryptic warning Hank received before the attack. Which, he relishes in pointing out, caused them to lose the upper hand and thereby their lives. Cartel boss Juan Bolsa is also dead, Gus reports with more sadistic glee. \"This is what comes,\" says Gus, quoting Bolsa's own phrase, \"of 'blood for blood'.\" \"Sangre por sangre,\" he repeats in Spanish, be it for emphasis or Tio's clear understanding; who is by now beside himself with rage, his red faced temper desperate to push through his paralysis, as Gus leaves him with a patronising pat on the knee. <br><br>As Tio rages, we cut to water that grows tinged with blood.",
